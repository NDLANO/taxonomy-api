Rest service and graph database for organizing content

Unless otherwise specified, all PUT and POST requests must use
`Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8`. If charset is omitted, UTF-8 will be assumed.
All GET requests will return data using the same content type.

When you remove an entity, its associations are also deleted. E.g., if you remove a subject,
its associations to any topics are removed. The topics themselves are not affected.
